# Fun with R, markdown, and CSS

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# For this online Rmd editor, the packages don't need to be loaded
# Put when working in RStudio, you would load your packages here

```


## Some starter CSS

You don't have to change the style of the `pre` HTML element (and if you do, don't change it to make it hard to read the code!)

```{css}
body {
    font-size: 12pt;
    font-family: Comic Sans MS;
}

pre {
    background-color: #ADD8E6;
    padding: 5px;
}
```


## Random cat!


```{r}
```

## Add an animated GIF using a URL from the web and markdown
