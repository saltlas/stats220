## Project requirements

I already have an existing GitHub account and have created a repo for all STATS 220 coursework [here](https://github.com/saltlas/stats220). I have a README.md for the root directory, it's not particularly creative as I don't really want anything silly to be put up on my public github, but I did include a funny cat site at the end. It does check all the boxes, though. The creativity mostly comes later with my meme.

I've chosen not to set up GitHub Pages as it's optional and I'm already familiar with GitHub, so I won't be including a link to the website.


I've created the project folder on my computer as shown:

## My meme

Here is the inspo meme: 
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/896269789142601728/1214402581523079259/inspo_meme.png?ex=65f8fb89&is=65e68689&hm=4877cf02a2b0a47c0552263d2e9c1a20cbf2ae6c1c5a75da48e15a70ed6a03eb&)

I decided to try to create a similar meme from scratch. It ended up being pretty long:
```{r meme-code, eval=TRUE}
library(magick)

# top section of meme including text and bullet points
top_section <- image_blank(width = 500,

image_write(final_meme, "my_meme.png")

Here is the animation code, but note that it only works under the assumption that the meme code has been run as it uses the meme as a base.
```{r animation-code, eval=FALSE}

# animation part, i'm giving it legs and arms (idk)
leg <- image_read("https://em-content.zobj.net/source/emojione/211/leg_1f9b5.png") %>%
  image_scale(90)

arm <- image_read("https://www.clker.com/cliparts/B/S/n/E/q/F/frog-green-right-arm-hi.png") %>%
  image_scale(80)

# generating different orientations for the arms for diff frames
arm1 <- arm
arm2 <- image_rotate(arm, 10) %>%
  image_transparent("white")
arm3 <- image_rotate(arm, 20) %>%
  image_transparent("white")
arm4 <- image_rotate(arm, -10) %>%
  image_transparent("white")
arm5 <- image_rotate(arm, -20) %>%
  image_transparent("white")

arms <- c(arm1, arm2, arm3, arm2, arm1, arm4, arm5, arm4)
arm_gif <- image_animate(arms)

# same thing for legs
leg1 <- leg
leg2 <- image_rotate(leg, 10) %>%
  image_transparent("white")
leg3 <- image_rotate(leg, 20) %>%
  image_transparent("white")
leg4 <- image_rotate(leg, -10) %>%
  image_transparent("white")
leg5 <- image_rotate(leg, -20) %>%
  image_transparent("white")

legs <- c(leg1, leg2, leg3, leg2, leg1, leg4, leg5, leg4)
leg_gif <- image_animate(legs)

# copy of the meme with a border for space for the limbs
blank <- image_border(final_meme, "white", "70x70") 

# placeholder initialization for the vector of frames
frames

for (frame in 1:8){
  # generating the gifs individually and then composite-ing them together gave me 4096 frames so we're doing it this way
  current_frame <- image_composite(anim, legs[frame], offset="+0+650") %>%
    image_composite(image_flop(legs[frame]), offset="+550+650") %>%
    image_composite(image_flop(arms[frame]), offset="+0+100") %>%
    image_composite(arms[frame], offset="+550+100")
  frames <- c(frames, current_frame)
}

final_gif <- image_animate(frames)
image_write(final_gif, "my_animation.gif")

```
Here is the gif it generates:

## Creativity

I demonstrated creativity in this project chiefly by using functions from the magick library that were not taught, as well as using the ones that were taught in creative ways.

Functions that I used that were not taught:

- image_composite

#### I used this for the gif frame creation and for the bottom section of the meme.


- image_border

#### I used this for the mid section of the meme and the gif creation.


- image_rotate

#### I used this for gif frame creation by rotating the limbs.


- image_flop

#### I used this in gif frame creation to mirror the limbs so that I only needed one arm image and one leg image.


- image_transparent

#### I used this in gif frame creation because while the images I used were transparent, rotating them for some reason generated a white background.

Functions that I used in new or interesting ways:

- image_append

#### For the mid section, I combined 3 images horizontally and then for the final meme I stacked the three sections vertically.

- image_annotate

#### I used arguments not covered in class, such as font weight and location

Bonus:

- Used a for loop

## Learning reflection

I learnt that code readability really makes a difference to the feel of a programming language. R errors are far more readable, and the language is easier to use and understand than languages like Java.

I thought that creating an image from scratch using code would be harder based off of my experiences with CSS, but image generation straight out of the box the way this project has taught is really cool! I can see how it would make generating plots of data super easy and fun.

I also really enjoyed learning about the c() and paste() functions in R as they are somewhat novel to me and seem very useful, especially for handling large amounts of data in easy and readable ways. Matching vectors to each other, especially in repeating patterns the way paste() does so is an incredibly useful concept and can save a lot of time.

I'm interested in learning more about how R differs from other programming languages, especially with regard to how it suits statistics more and its unique functions (like paste()" to aid statisticians. I'm also excited to see how what we've learnt so far can translate into data processing rather than meme generation, as I can already see some ways it would be great for such a task.
